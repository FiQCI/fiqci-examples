    "### II) Problem formulation: MaxCut\n",
    "\n",
    "MaxCut is a combinatorial optimization problem. The goal of solving the MaxCut problem is to find a cut that divides the vertices of a graph into two complementary sets while maximizing the number of edges between the sets.\n",
    "We can formulate the MaxCut problem in terms of the **cost function** $C$, which describes the goal of having connected vertices belonging to different partitions using the logical operators called exclusive-OR (XOR).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Classical cost function**\n",
    " \n",
    "We denote the exclusive-OR operator as $\\wedge$ (In Python, bitwise XOR is represented by `^`). For example, given binary numbers $A,B \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "A \\wedge B = \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "    1,              & \\text{if } A \\neq B \\\\\n",
    "    0,              & \\text{if } A=B \n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use these kinds of boolean clauses to formulate our **cost function** $C$. To do this, we state that we have two partitions, which we label 0-partition and 1-partition. We assign variable $v_i \\in \\{ 0,1 \\}$, that states in which partition vertex number $i$ is located. Now, if we have an edge $(i,j)$, the associated pair of variables $(v_i, v_j)$ has XOR operation\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "v_i \\wedge v_j = \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "    1,              & \\text{if } v_i \\neq v_j \\quad \\text{i.e vertices belong in different partitions} \\\\\n",
    "    0,              & \\text{if } v_i =v_j     \\quad \\text{i.e vertices belong in same partition}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "The cost function $C$ is a sum of these operations, where each term corresponds to one edge in the graph. The cost function achieves maximum when the number of cut edges is as large as possible.\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "C = \\sum_{(i,j) \\in \\text{edges} } v_i \\wedge v_j\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If a graph, where $v_i$ represents $i^\\text{th}$ vertex, has a set of edges $\\{(0, 1)$, $(1, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, $(0, 3)\\}$, the cost function is\n",

    "C = v_0 \\wedge v_1 + v_1 \\wedge v_2 + v_2 \\wedge v_3 + v_0 \\wedge v_3\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "The maximum value of this cost function is 4, which means none of the adjacent vertices belong to the same partition, ie. $v_0=v_2=0$ and $v_1=v_3=1$.\n",
    "On the other hand, the minimum value is 0, in case all of them belong to the same partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is where binary numbers come into the picture. In a graph of $N$ vertices, a single binary number $v=v_0v_1v_2v_3... v_i...v_N$, where $v_i$ is for $i^\\text{th}$ vertex, can tell for all vertices whether they are in 0-partition or 1-partition.\n",
    "Basically, we can write the cost function as a sum\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "C = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{m} C_\\alpha(v), \n",

    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "Since the binary number $v=v_0v_1v_2v_3... v_i...v_N$ tells us exactly in which of the two partitions all the vertices in the graph belong, it also tells us how to cut the graph to achieve such a partition. The binary number that maximizes the cost function (the number of edges between the sets), thus solves the problem."
