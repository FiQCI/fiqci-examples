    "# 04: Deutsch's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Deutsch's algorithm from 1985 is the first and simplest quantum algorithm. Its significance lies in the fact that it solves a specific problem, *Deutsch's problem*, faster than any classical algorithm.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**The Deutsch's problem:** Consider a function $f : \\{0,1\\} \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$ (a function that can take $0$ or $1$ as an input and returns $0$ or $1$ as an output). Is it true that $f(0)=f(1)$?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Any classical algorithm would have to evaluate the function $f(x)$ twice, once with $x=0$ and once with $x=1$, to see if the results coincide or not. By using *superposition* and *interference*, quantum computing allows us to solve the problem with a single evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deutsch's algorithm is executed as a simple quantum circuit with two qubits. In brief, the idea is to evaluate the given problem function $f(x)$ using a superposition of $0$ and $1$ as an input. With the help of an auxiliary qubit, whose state is interfered with the input qubit, a single execution of Deutsch's algorithm reveals whether the studied function is **constant** or **varied**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 'oracle' function $f(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lingo of computer science, black box functions that give some output for a given input, but whose internal details are not relevant or known, are called *oracles*. The aim of Deutsch's algorithm is to solve whether a given oracle function is **constant** or **varied**.\n",

    "- **Varied (NOT-function):** $f(0) \\neq f(1)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "### The quantum oracle $U_f$ \n",
    "\n",
    "To make a quantum version of the oracle function, we have to represent it as a quantum gate. Since all quantum gates have to be **reversible** (no information can be lost), we need two qubits to realize a one-bit oracle function $f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum oracle gate $U_f$ operates on a arbitraty two-qubit state as: $U_f|\\hspace{0.1cm}x~ y\\hspace{-0.1cm}> = |\\hspace{0.1cm}x~ y \\oplus f(x) >$, where $\\oplus$ means *addition modulo two*. The four possible input combinations are:\n",

    "2) $\\quad 0 \\oplus 1=1$\n",
    "3) $\\quad 1 \\oplus 0=1$\n",
    "4) $\\quad 1 \\oplus 1=0$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step of demonstrating the Deutsch algorithm on Qiskit, we prepare an 'unknown' quantum oracle $U_f$, that realizes the oracle function $f(x)$ in a reversible way. We want to choose our oracle gate randomly (**so that we don't know what it exactly is**). In this notebook, we will use Deutsch's algorithm to see whether our oracle function $f(x)$ is:\n",
